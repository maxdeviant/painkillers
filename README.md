painkillers
===========

Make the pain of Windows dev more tolerable.

## Disclaimer

These are my personal painkillers for Windows development. As such, some of the features are tailored towards my specific preferences and work environment. However, I hope that some of them prove useful, if only as examples.

## Todo

* [ ] Add interactive install script to allow for personalized PowerShell profiles.
* [ ] Beef up install script to install and configure various applications.
